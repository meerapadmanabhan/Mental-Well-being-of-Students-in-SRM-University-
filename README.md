### Introduction
This is a power bi dashboard which give insights on Mental well being of students in SRM University. 
Mental health among college students can vary widely, as it does in any population. Many students thrive academically and emotionally during their college years, while others may face challenges. The transition to college life, academic pressures, financial stress, and social changes can contribute to mental health issues. Common challenges include anxiety, depression, and stress.

It's crucial for students to be aware of available mental health resources on campus and seek support when needed. Universities often have counseling services, and destigmatizing mental health discussions can make it easier for students to reach out for help. Remember, it's okay to ask for supportâ€”it's a sign of strength, not weakness. If you or someone you know is struggling, reaching out to professionals or trusted individuals can make a significant difference.

Targeted interventions and support programs tailored to the specific needs of male students at the Kattankulathur campus could prove effective in addressing their mental health challenges.
